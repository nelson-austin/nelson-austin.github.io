            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>A chamber of commerce is a collection of business owners. Therefore, one target audience would be the specific target market of each business. Another would be to bring those that are considering relocating to the city. Phoenix isn't really considered a retirement city so the main audience would be families and college kids.</p>
            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>David who is 30 years old and father to two kids. He is from Las Vegas but thinking of relocating to the Phoenix area. He has a job in mechanical engineering. He's not too picky with design, he just wants to find out what he needs to know quickly and efficiently. Site is accessed through a computer.</p>
            <p>Lacey who is 20 years old and is going to college at ASU. She is new to the area and is just looking for fun things to do and places to go nearby. She would connect more with a vibrant design but cares more about having a reliable source and information. Site is accessed through a phone.</p>
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>Where can I find the best deals on clothing here in town? Are there any sales?</p>
            <p>Are there any jobs available? Who all is hiring?</p>
            <p>What fun things are there to do this weekend? Is there anything going on?</p>
            <p>Which local businesses should I trust and which should I stay away from.</p>
            <p>What's the weather going to be like the following week? When should I plan my conference?</p>
