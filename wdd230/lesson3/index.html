            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>A Chamber of Commerce is a group of business owners and entrepeneurs who promote the interests of their local community. They may provide access to valuable resources, discounts, and relationships that help both the community and the businesses themselves. As a fictional Chamber of Commerce in Arizona, this website will be used in these ways and to also attract more people to the city as well. There will be a discover page to showcase historical sites and other fun things to do, a directory of local businesses, an application to join the chamber, and a contact page.</p>
