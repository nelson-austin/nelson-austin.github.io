      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you ever want an escape? You’re drowning at work. Assignments keep piling up and you don’t know when if it’ll ever end. But then it does. What are your plans for the weekend?
        I have the perfect idea for those avid for adventure. There is a new theme park in Idaho Falls! Anyone is welcome. Check us out on our website that I’ll be creating shortly. We’ll have pictures and videos of all our family friendly rides and a spot to showcase our bigger ones for those looking for even more thrill. The perfect place for the perfect price.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My web site is going to feature a theme park. Typically, the majority of people that you would see there are families, groups of friends, and youth groups. This will be my main audience.
        In order to bring in families, I will showcase our safety ratings and how we have never had an injury or death at our park. And then to bring in youth groups and older friends, I will showcase pictures of exciting rides. That way, moms will feel safe bringing their kids and older friends won’t think our rides are boring.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <h5>Goal of Home Page</h5>
      <p>
        I will be creating a website to advertise for a new theme park. The focus of the main page will be just to showcase general information about the park. Most of the people that we are marketing to are visual people. They would probably much rather see pictures and/or videos of our park instead of mainly just reading about it. To achieve this, our main page will use small portions of text to emphasize the visual media displayed on our front page. These pictures would mainly be of our popular rides that we have throughout the park. 
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

        <img src="images/another-picture2.jpg" alt="image for homepage">
        <img src="images/site-map.jpg" alt="map">

      </ul>
      <h3>Why Us?</h3>
      <h5>Goal of 'Why Us?' Page</h5>
      <p>
        The next page that I want to incorporate is a ‘why us’ page. These types of pages are a great opportunity to focus on our specific audience. As I stated earlier, the majority of people that you would see at a theme park are families, groups of friends, and youth groups. It’s possible that you may see different kinds of people but the first three groups are the people that drive most of the sales. In order to market to them, this page will have three main focuses. We are safe, fun, and affordable.
      </p>
      <h5>Safety</h5>
      <p>To start off, in order to attract younger families to our park, we will have a section of the page focused on safety. A picture of a child having fun on a slower ride will be shown along with a bolded statement saying that we have never had any accidents or injuries on any of our rides. This will be the focus for the top of the page. </p>
      <h5>Fun</h5>
      <p>Next, we will take a turn marketing towards families with older children and older groups of friends. We will showcase a picture of our newest ride with reviews from third party groups about how fast and fun it is. If there’s room we’ll also add an area for rewards from different third party services as well.</p>
      <h5>Affordability</h5>
      <p>Finally, to bring it all together, we will end the page focusing on affordability. This is something that would be important to all of our audience so we will save it for last to bring everyone together. To show that we have great prices for what we are offering. We will come up with a creative display where there is a mini map of the park to show the numerous rides that we have with the prices right next to the model. Right below that, will be a link for the user to buy tickets. With this layout, the user will be excited both for the park and the competitive pricing that we are offering.</p>

        <img src="images/test-image3.jpg" alt="image for why us?">

      </ul>
      <h3>Buy Tickets</h3>
      <h5>Goal of Buy Tickets Page</h5>
      <p>
        On the previous 'why us?' page, we have the plan of incorporating a mini map of the park with pricing and a link to buy tickets. That link will bring the user to this page where they can buy tickets. On this page, we will go even more in depth with the different parts of our theme park. At the top, we will have the pricing for a day pass to both the water rides and the rollercoasters along with discounts for families and large parties. Next, we will have an area specifically for the water rides and pricing to just enter that area and another area designated for the roller coasters and the pricing to just enter that area. Finally at the end, we will showcase our special events and special deals for different upcoming days throughout the month and/or year. Throughout the page will be different links to enter the payment portal where the user would enter in how many people are in there party.
