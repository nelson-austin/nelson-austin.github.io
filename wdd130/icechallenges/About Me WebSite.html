    <h2>Austin Nelson</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! In the picture above, I am on the far right. My name is Austin and I am from Alabama. I grew up in a family of seven and I am the second of five siblings. In my free time I like playing sports or being out on the water.</p>
    <p>I recently switched my major from biochemistry to computer science so this class will be my first taste of web development. I'm excited to see how it goes! I'm still relatively new to programming but as of right now, my plan is to go into data science.</p>
